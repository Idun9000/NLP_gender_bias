# Exam Project: Tracking Gender Bias in Fictional Literature Over Time

### Objective

This project investigates whether changes in societal gender biases, particularly in the last century, are reflected in fictional literature. As society has moved toward gender equality, as evidenced by increased female employment rates and salary equity, this study asks if these developments are mirrored in literature. By examining gender bias in literature across time, we aim to understand how representations of gendered concepts have evolved.
